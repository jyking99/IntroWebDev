        The movie I’m reviewing is The Cat Returns by Studio Ghibli.
        Protagonist of this movie is an ordinary middle school student Haru, who one day rescues a cat from a
        speeding truck. A typical Japanese cartoon movie opening, right? But things really get fantasy from here.
        Later, a troop of cats visits her late at night, and tells her that the cat was actually the prince of the
        Cat Kingdom. They were going to take Haru to the Cat Kingdom and plan a marriage between the cat prince and
        Haru.
        Haru was of course not eager to marry a cat, so she tried desperately to get out of the situation.
        Fortunately, she finds two stray cats to help her, and from there, it’s a story of friendship, romance, and
        scandals between the world of cats and the world of humans. It’s really a cute movie, and the characters of
        the cats in the movie was really entertaining to watch.
