<h1>My Background</h1>
    I am an undergraduate senior student at Boston College, and I am studying mathematics and computer science. I have taken a few computer science courses, some courses involving some webpage programming, but never systematically studied HTML/CSS/javascript.

<h1>My Interest in Web Development</h1>
    I am looking forward to get a job related to web development, and also creating personal websites for my hobbies such as videogames. 

<h1>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports or Hobbies</h1>
    I like to play videogames and watch TV shows/movies. 

<h1>What I Hope to Gain from This Course</h1>
    I hope to have the ability to design a webpage that is functional and easy to use, and also informative. Even better if it would create more job opportunities for me in the future.
